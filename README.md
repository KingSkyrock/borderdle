## How to Play:

#### Find the correct country in 7 guesses!

You begin with an empty canvas but with each guess, a larger part of the country's border gets revealed.
The full outline of the country will be revealed after your 6th guess, leaving you one last chance to get it right.
Each guess must be a valid country name, validated by the autocomplete popup. Hit the enter button to submit your answer.
